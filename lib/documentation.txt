Flutter Lifecyle

Every thing in flutter is a widget

There are 2 types of widget
1. Stateless Widget :  This can only be created once. Can never be recreated
2. Stateful Widget: This can be recreated when the data state has be updated. Recreated to render the new state change.
THe build function can run multiple times.
